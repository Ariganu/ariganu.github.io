Space is **vast**. How do I handle it?

When you need to deliver 1 million cubic meters of tritium it's not the journey that matters, you actually have to go and deliver.

*If you are a journey-enjoyer, more power to you. I'm here to ship things! -with a ship.*

Managing your solo development comes with a few sliders that affect each other directly, including but not limited to:
Scope, Visual Fidelity, Time and Probability of Finishing.

What makes a game unique (and shippable in a reasonable amount of time) is adding nuances to these sliders. Accesorizing them, adding cute stickers and threatening spikes rather than just moving them around and hoping for the best.

When I realized that scope had become my public enemy number one, I had to take a step back and think.

I came down on visual fidelity hard. I pushed it into the depths of the earth, burned it with the ancient fire of its core, smelted it, shaped it. Then pulled it back, because I didn't want to make an interactive excel sheet.

I've come up with ways to keep the game visually appealing, immersive and generally nice to look at. First thought when someone sees the game should be "oh neat".

I'm constantly looking new ways to present the game in unique and beautiful ways that is trivial to produce. You wouldn't believe how fast I can create spaceships on a blender once I have a design on my mind. Game's aesthetic direction enables me to have easily producable designs too.

**Compromising shouldn't be about scrapping things as a whole. It should be about adapting the concept in a unique and production friendly way.**

CR56M's scope is as vast as the space but don't worry, it's not nearly empty as such.
