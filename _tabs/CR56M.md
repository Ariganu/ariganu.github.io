CR56M is the codename of our latest video game.

CR56M is an immersive sci-fi game. It is text and UI heavy with beautiful in-universe visualizations, with a user friendly approach that is easy to learn and master.

Our goal is to make CR56M one of the most immersive science fiction games you can play.

From total freedom to absolute organized chaos you can create your own story in any way you want, with any pace you want. You get to decide what to play and how much you want to play. Game's scope is whatever you want it to be. You decide your level of involvement with the universe.

You don't like freedom? Game will hold your hand to accomplish your goals, or give you goals that will drive you.

CR56M's core mechanics consist of modules. We will announce modules and showcase them throughout the development process.
