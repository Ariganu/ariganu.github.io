I support artists and creators. Copyrights and original works must be respected.

I never use AI generated images or content in a public product. Commercial or not.

Some images featured on blog entries are the product of AI image generators. These are purely to help me and readers visualize some concepts in a simple way during the early development phase.

**They will only be featured in this blog.**
**AI content will never be in the game at any capacity.**

CR56M is a UI and text heavy game. It will feature images and 3d models created by me, by my partner or a paid artist if I commit to a budget.
