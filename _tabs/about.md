I'm Ariganu. The soul maker, sound shaker.

It means you get a refined look to the matrix through me.

I live to love and create.

CR56M is not an exclusively solo dev venture. My partner in life, my precious, talented and smart significant other Pawketful sees and hears everything I do and makes them better than I could even imagine. We've decided to brand CR56M mainly through Ariganu, we also have works under Pawligan.

CR56M represents my love for science fiction and video games where I get to combine it with my passion for music, art and coding.

---

This dev blog will document thoughts, processes, concepts and everything else related to CR56M's development.
